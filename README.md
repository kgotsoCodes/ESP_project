# ESP_project

The following Repository is based on a project briefing given to me by ESP

The project uploads an image, resizes the image and displays it back
We have init.php which is used to instantiate our class and require all the relevant files needed to execute our project
We have a connect folder which holds the database.php which used to connect to our database
We a classes folder which holds the Uploader class,
The Uploader class has functions used to insert the image details on our database, functions to create a unique so they are no clashes when upholding and to ensure unique directories for our images and functions for resizes our images based on the requirement for both staff photo and product images respectively.
The code for validating our images is written on separate page to encourage code reuse
The index.php file is used to upload our images
The view_image.php file is used to view the image and its details from the image direcotory and database respectively
This project was a fun one filled with lots of learning and relizations about myself
